# Task 3: Multi-Cloud Architecture â€“ GCP + AWS

## Objective
To design and demonstrate a working multi-cloud application architecture that connects a frontend hosted on **Google Cloud Storage (GCP)** to a backend Flask API hosted on an **AWS EC2 instance**.

---

## Architecture Overview

- **Frontend**: Static HTML hosted in a GCP Cloud Storage bucket
- **Backend**: Flask API running on AWS EC2
- **Communication**: HTTP call from GCP to AWS
- **CORS** enabled to allow cross-origin requests

## Steps Performed

### ðŸ”¹ AWS (Backend)
- Launched EC2 instance with Amazon Linux 2023
- Installed Python, Flask, and Flask-CORS
- Ran API on port 80 returning `Hello from AWS EC2 Flask Backend!`
- Configured security group to allow HTTP access (port 80)

### ðŸ”¹ GCP (Frontend)
- Created a static HTML page that makes an HTTP fetch call to the AWS EC2 API
- Uploaded it to a GCP bucket
- Made the file public and accessed it via the bucket's public URL
